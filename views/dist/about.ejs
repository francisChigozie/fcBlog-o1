                        After the last covid-2019 experience, I have witnessed how
                        helpful the Internet was to people during the lock-downs.

                        Design and I have received professional training (Coding Boot Camp) to
                        becoming a Web and App. <br><br>
                        The Thema digitalization is my watch word. As the impacts of covid-2019 is incresing
                        disrupting every normal way of living, I am constantly developping digital platforms
                        with the aim of reaching everyone.</p>
